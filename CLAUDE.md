# CLAUDE.md — Entry point for Claude Code (and any other agent/human)

> Read this first. This file orients any coding agent (or new human contributor) working on
> **Heartwood**. The full design lives in the Obsidian-style vault at
> [`docs/`](docs/index.md) — start at `docs/index.md`. If this file and the vault ever
> disagree, the vault wins; fix this file.

## ⛔ Workflow — non-negotiable (read this before writing ANY code)

Every coding task on Heartwood follows this order. No exceptions, no shortcuts — even for a
"trivial" change. **We build strictly test-first (TDD).**

1. **READ THE DOCS FIRST.** Start at [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md). Find the notes relevant
   to the task (domain entity, feature, ADR) and read them. The vault is the source of truth;
   the code must match the design recorded there. If the docs are silent or wrong, update the
   docs *first*, then proceed.
2. **WRITE THE TEST NEXT (Minitest).** Write a failing Minitest test that expresses the desired
   behavior — model/unit, integration, or system test as appropriate. Run it and **watch it
   fail** (red). No production code is written before a failing test exists for it.
3. **THEN WRITE THE CODE.** Write the minimum code to make the test pass (green). Run the test
   and watch it pass.
4. **REFACTOR.** Clean up with tests staying green. Then run the full suite (`bin/rails test`)
   before considering the task done.

Red → Green → Refactor. If you catch yourself writing production code without a failing test
in front of it, stop and go back to step 2. Minitest only — **no RSpec** (see constraints below).

```bash
export PATH=~/.local/share/mise/installs/ruby/4.0.5/bin:$PATH
bin/rails test                         # full suite
bin/rails test test/models/person_test.rb   # one file
bin/rails test test/models/person_test.rb:42 # one test by line
```

## What this project is

Heartwood is an **open-source, self-hostable genealogy / family-tree platform** with an
optional **paid hosted plan** — built to be *the cloud, collaborative counterpart to Gramps*:
the same evidence-first domain depth, but a family editing one tree together from a browser
instead of one person's local file. Open core licensed AGPL-3.0; the goal is a
*reference-quality* ("эталонное") canonical Rails 8 application. See [[vision]],
[[positioning]].

## Build it as if DHH and 37signals made it — not "inspired by," based on the actual source

For Rails/Hotwire/CSS architecture (not genealogy domain logic — see [[prior-art]] for that
split), don't improvise a Rails style from general knowledge. Three reference apps are cloned
at `~/dhh-references/`; **read their actual source and base the code and architectural
decisions on it**:

- **once-campfire** and **Writebook** (both MIT) — the primary references. Controllers,
  models, views, CSS: read the real files, not just the rendered UI, before building the
  Heartwood equivalent. Our `.btn`/`.input`/`.avatar`/icon primitives, the OKLCH color
  tokens, the member-row + invite-link shape — all adapted directly from these two.
- **fizzy** — style/technique reference only (e.g. the mask-image icon approach). Its license
  has a SaaS non-compete clause, so no literal fizzy assets or code ship in this repo — MIT
  icons come from campfire instead (see `app/assets/images/NOTICE.md`).

Full detail and the "what to take from what" map: [[prior-art]].

## Key strategic features & tasks — keep these front of mind

These are the product's actual differentiation, not just items on a backlog — every feature
decision should be checked against them (per [[positioning]]'s own filter).

### 1. Bilingual from day one — a precondition, not a nicety
Shipping English + Russian now, on generic Rails I18n (`t()`, `config/locales/*.yml`), because
"popular open-source app worldwide" requires people who don't read English to use it
comfortably. Every new user-facing string goes through I18n; no hardcoded copy. See
[[vision]] principle 3, [[positioning]] "why we win" #5.

### 2. The Gramps round-trip — the flagship interop story
Not just generic GEDCOM support: **Heartwood cloud collaboration ↔ Gramps local power-tools**
is meant to feel like one workflow.

```
Family fills in the tree together in Heartwood (cloud, live, multiple relatives)
        → export GEDCOM 7.0 / GEDZIP
        → open in Gramps (free, local, offline — reports, DNA tools, custom filters)
        → edit further there
        → re-import into Heartwood, merges back into the shared cloud tree
```

We take Gramps' *mechanics* (evidence-first sources/citations, the domain depth) and rebuild
them in a canonical Rails 8 app that is more convenient and intuitive than Gramps' desktop UI
— but we deliberately do **not** chase feature-parity with Gramps' deep power-user tooling
(reports, DNA, plugins). We hand off to real Gramps for that instead of rebuilding it badly.
Full detail: [[gedcom]] "The Gramps round-trip", [[import-export]], [[positioning]].

### 3. The owner drives two distinct kinds of link — don't conflate them
- **Edit invites** (shipped — see [[collaboration]]): the tree owner shares a `join_code`
  link; whoever joins through it gets a real account and an editor/viewer role, and can help
  fill in the tree.
- **View-only share links** (not yet built — see [[privacy-access]] "Share links"): the owner
  generates a separate link to let someone just *look at* the tree (or one branch/person) —
  no account, no `TreeMembership` row, nothing to sign up for. This is its own token/model,
  not a repurposed `Tree#join_code` — a view link must never grant edit access.

## Hard stack constraints (do not violate)

This is a **canonical "vanilla Rails 8" app, on purpose**. Before adding any dependency,
check it against these rules — they are the whole point of the project:

- ✅ **Ruby on Rails 8.1**, Ruby 4.0.x
- ✅ **SQLite** in development *and production* — see [[adr/0002-sqlite-production]]
- ✅ **Hotwire** (Turbo + Stimulus) for all interactivity — no SPA
- ✅ **Vanilla CSS** (modern CSS: nesting, custom properties) — **NO Tailwind / Bootstrap**
- ✅ **Propshaft + importmap** — **NO Node, NO esbuild/Vite, NO bundler step**
- ✅ **Solid Queue / Cache / Cable** — **NO Redis**
- ✅ **Minitest** (omakase) — **NO RSpec**
- ✅ **Kamal** for deploy
- ⚠️ The **only** place raw JavaScript is justified is the family-tree graph layout, wrapped
  in a single Stimulus controller — see [[architecture/tree-rendering]].

If a task seems to need React/Node/Redis/Tailwind, that is a signal to stop and reconsider,
not to add it.

## How to run things in this environment

Ruby is installed via **mise** but its shims are **not** on PATH in non-interactive shells.
Prepend the bin dir in every command:

```bash
export PATH=~/.local/share/mise/installs/ruby/4.0.5/bin:$PATH
bin/rails server      # or: bin/rails test, bin/rails console, etc.
```

## Where to find things

- **Vision & principles** → [[vision]]
- **Positioning & strategy** → [[positioning]]
- **Domain model** (Person, Family, Event, Source…) → [[domain-model]]
- **Feature catalog** (what we borrow & prioritize) → [[features-index]]
- **Import/export & GEDCOM** → [[gedcom]], [[import-export]]
- **Collaboration** (roles, invites, share links) → [[collaboration]], [[privacy-access]]
- **Architecture & decisions (ADRs)** → [[stack]], `docs/architecture/adr/`
- **Business model** (open core, pricing) → [[open-core]], [[pricing-hosting]]
- **Roadmap** → [[roadmap]]
- **Prior art we learn from** → [[prior-art]]

## Conventions for editing the docs vault

- Atomic notes, one concept per file. Link liberally with `[[wikilinks]]`.
- Every note has YAML frontmatter: `title`, `tags`, `status` (`draft`/`stable`).
- The vault is the **single source of truth**: design decisions live here, not in chat.
