# Joining a tree via its shareable invite link — once-campfire's join-code
# mechanic, adapted per-tree. Deliberately requires authentication like any
# other controller (no allow_unauthenticated_access): an unauthenticated
# visitor is bounced through the existing sign-in-or-register flow and lands
# back here afterward via Authentication#after_authentication_url. See
# [[collaboration]].
