# GEDCOM — the accepted exchange format

> Interop is our **moat** (see [[vision]] principle #1). The reason people will trust
> Heartwood is that they can always leave — and the reason they'll *come* is that they can
> bring their whole tree from Ancestry / MyHeritage / Gramps / FamilySearch.

## What GEDCOM is
**GE**nealogical **D**ata **COM**munication — the de-facto standard text format for exchanging
family-tree data. A GEDCOM file is line-oriented records (`0 @I1@ INDI`, `1 BIRT`, `2 DATE …`).
Our [[domain-model]] is deliberately GEDCOM-shaped so mapping is near-lossless.

## Versions — what we support

| Version | Year | Our stance |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **GEDCOM 5.5.1** | 2019 (long de-facto) | **Import (tolerant).** What almost every legacy app exports. Must read it well. |
| **GEDCOM 7.0** | 2021+, by FamilySearch | **Native import + export.** The modern spec (UTF-8, structured, versioned). Our canonical output. |
| **GEDCOM X** | FamilySearch | *Could*, later. A JSON/XML API model, not a file format — different use case. |
| **GEDZIP** | part of v7 | Support — bundles the GEDCOM + media into one `.gz`/`.zip`. Great for full backups. |

**Decision:** export **7.0** (with GEDZIP for media), import **both 5.5.1 and 7.0** tolerantly.

## The Gramps round-trip — a named flagship workflow, not just "another GEDCOM vendor"

This is the concrete story behind [[positioning]]'s "webtrees-grade openness": **Gramps is
the reference desktop-open-source genealogy tool, and Heartwood + Gramps together should feel
like one workflow, not two disconnected apps that happen to share a file format.**

```
Family collaborates in Heartwood (cloud, multiple relatives, live editing — [[collaboration]])
        │  Export → GEDCOM 7.0 / GEDZIP
        ▼
Open in Gramps (free, local, offline, deep power-user tools: reports, DNA tools, custom filters)
        │  Edit further, verify sources, run Gramps-only analysis
        ▼
Re-import into Heartwood → merges/updates back into the shared cloud tree
```

Gramps' own native format is Gramps XML — GEDCOM is the correct interop layer regardless (it's
what Gramps itself imports/exports for anything not staying purely inside Gramps), so no
Gramps-specific parser is needed on our side. What *is* Gramps-specific and worth doing
deliberately:
- **Test the round-trip against real Gramps output**, not just our own GEDCOM — Gramps has its
  own dialect quirks (tag choices, custom event types) worth a dedicated fixture in the GEDCOM
  parser test suite.
- **Name it in the product**, not just support it silently: the export screen/docs should say
  *"Works great with Gramps"* explicitly — most users won't discover the workflow otherwise.
- **Win on convenience where Gramps is weak**: multi-person live cloud collaboration (Gramps
  Web exists but is a separate, heavier project) is the thing Gramps desktop fundamentally
  cannot do alone — that's Heartwood's half of the pairing. See [[positioning]] "Not
  feature-parity with Gramps" — we don't chase Gramps' desktop power-features (deep
  report/DNA/plugin tooling); we hand off to Gramps for those instead of rebuilding them.

## Hard truths (be honest about these)
- GEDCOM interop is **never perfectly lossless in practice** — vendors add custom tags
  (`_CUSTOM`), encodings vary (ANSEL in old files!), and structure differs. Our rule:
  **never drop data.** Unknown tags get preserved in a raw/`extra` store and surfaced, not
  discarded. A user must never lose information by importing into Heartwood.
- Keep original `@xref@` ids (`gedcom_xref` fields across the [[domain-model]]) so a
  round-trip import → export → import is **stable**. This is a Phase-2 acceptance test.

## Implementation notes
- Lean on a Ruby GEDCOM parsing gem if a maintained one fits the vanilla-stack rule; otherwise
  a small hand-written line parser is very doable (the grammar is simple). Evaluate in Phase 2.
- The whole pipeline (upload → parse → map → report) is described in [[import-export]].
